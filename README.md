  <em>A coordination layer for multi-agent systems — shared rooms, persistent memory, and semantic negotiation, built on the Internet of Cognition.</em>

## The Problem

AI agents are powerful individually, but they can't think together. When multiple agents work on the same problem, there's no shared memory, no way to negotiate trade-offs, and no context that persists across sessions. Every conversation starts from zero.

## What Mycelium Does

Mycelium gives agents **rooms** to coordinate in, **persistent memory** that compounds across sessions, and a **CognitiveEngine** that mediates negotiation so agents never have to talk directly to each other.

```bash
# Agent 1 shares context in a persistent room
mycelium memory set "position/julia" "I think we should use REST, not GraphQL" --handle julia-agent

# Agent 2 (hours later, different session) reads and adds their perspective
mycelium memory search "API design decisions"
mycelium memory set "position/selina" "Agree on REST, but we need pagination standards" --handle selina-agent

# CognitiveEngine synthesizes when enough context accumulates
mycelium room synthesize
```

When agents need to agree on something in real time, they join a sync room and CognitiveEngine runs structured negotiation:

```bash
mycelium room join --handle julia-agent -m "budget=high, scope=full"
# CognitiveEngine drives propose/respond rounds until consensus
```

## How It Works

Three pillars from the [Internet of Cognition](https://outshift.cisco.com) architecture:

**1. Coordination Protocol** (Shared Intent) — Rooms with a state machine (`idle → waiting → negotiating → complete`). CognitiveEngine orchestrates multi-issue negotiation via NegMAS. Agents respond to structured proposals; they never address each other directly.

**2. Persistent Memory** (Shared Context) — Namespaced key-value store with semantic vector search. Memories persist across sessions, accumulate across agents, and are searchable by meaning, not just keywords. Backed by AgensGraph + pgvector.

**3. Knowledge Graph** (Collective Innovation) — Two-stage LLM extraction turns agent conversations into structured concepts and relationships in an openCypher graph. CognitiveEngine queries this to inform future negotiations.

## Room Modes

| Mode | When to use | How it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **sync** | Agents are online together, need to agree now | 60s join window → NegMAS negotiation → consensus |
| **async** | Agents contribute across sessions | Persistent namespace, CognitiveEngine synthesizes on trigger |
| **hybrid** | Accumulate context, then negotiate | Write memories, then escalate to sync when ready |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install mycelium-cli
mycelium install

# Create a room and start sharing context
mycelium room create my-project --mode async
mycelium room set my-project
mycelium memory set "context/goal" "Build a REST API for the new service"
mycelium memory set "decision/db" "PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings"

# Search what's been shared
mycelium memory search "database decisions"

# See everything in the room
mycelium memory ls
```

## Architecture

Everything runs on a single **AgensGraph** instance (PostgreSQL 16 fork):
- SQL tables for rooms, sessions, messages, memories
- openCypher for the knowledge graph
- pgvector for semantic memory search
- LISTEN/NOTIFY for real-time SSE streaming

No external message broker, no separate vector DB, no Redis. One database.

```
mycelium-cli/         CLI + adapters (OpenClaw, Claude Code)
fastapi-backend/      FastAPI coordination engine
mycelium-client/      Generated typed OpenAPI client
```

## Adapters

Mycelium integrates with AI coding agents via adapters:

**Claude Code** — Lifecycle hooks capture tool use and context automatically. The mycelium skill provides memory and coordination commands.

```bash
mycelium adapter add claude-code
```

**OpenClaw** — Plugin + hooks for the OpenClaw agent runtime. Same coordination protocol, same memory API.

```bash
mycelium adapter add openclaw
```

## Metrics Dashboard

Mycelium includes an optional agent metrics dashboard powered by [ClawMetry](https://github.com/vivekchand/clawmetry), providing real-time observability for OpenClaw agents.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd mycelium-cli
pnpm run build:metrics                         # install ClawMetry
mycelium adapter add openclaw --step=otel      # enable OTEL export in openclaw
mycelium metrics start --otel                  # start dashboard with OTLP receiver
# → http://localhost:8900
# then restart your openclaw gateway to pick up the config change
```

### What you get

- **Flow** — Live animated diagram of messages flowing through channels, brain, tools
- **Usage** — Token and cost tracking with daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns
- **Sessions** — Active agent sessions with model, tokens, last activity
- **Health** — Gateway, disk, memory, uptime checks
- **Crons** — Scheduled job status and timing
- **Transcripts** — Chat-bubble UI for reading session histories

### OTLP receiver mode

For richer token metrics (real token counts, cost calculations, model breakdowns), enable OTLP export from OpenClaw to the ClawMetry dashboard:

```bash
# 1. Configure the local gateway and enable OTEL export
mycelium adapter add openclaw --step=local-gateway --step=otel

# 2. Start the dashboard with the OTLP receiver enabled
mycelium metrics start --otel
```

Steps can be combined (`--step=local-gateway --step=otel`) or run individually. When combined, the gateway restarts once at the end.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mycelium adapter add openclaw --step=local-gateway` | Write Mycelium env vars into systemd service |
| `mycelium adapter add openclaw --step=otel` | Enable OTEL export in `openclaw.json` |
| `mycelium metrics start` | Start dashboard in background |
| `mycelium metrics start --fg` | Start in foreground |
| `mycelium metrics start --otel` | Start with OTLP receiver |
| `mycelium metrics start --host 0.0.0.0` | Allow remote access |
| `mycelium metrics stop` | Stop dashboard |
| `mycelium metrics status` | Check if dashboard is running |
| `mycelium metrics open` | Open dashboard in browser |

## Development

```bash
cd fastapi-backend
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest tests/                    # unit tests (SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=... uv run pytest tests/   # integration tests (AgensGraph)
```
